This file stores potential new features of the project:

- To do web scrapping based on DOI, if ArXiD is not available
-- probably use the API of the OpenCitation database (http://opencitations.net/datasets)
- add checkboxes to select web scrapping source
- To do web scrapping for all references, if #(references) > 25 in the Havard's database
- Show all descendants of a selected paper
